# Introduction to Sociotechnical Architecture Maps

Sociotechnical Architecture Maps (STA-Maps) offer open and adaptable elements for the visualization of sociotechnical systems and architectures. They are able to provide a holistic overview of the building blocks and espcially their dynamics and dependencies for complex and adaptive systems. STA-Maps aim to be flexible and help in visualizing and discussing the trade-offs of complex sociotechnical systems and their evolution. Explicitly STA-Maps offer no best practices or one-size-fits-all solutions.

## Why would I use STA-Maps

STA-Maps help you to visualize and discuss topics like:

- Aligments between domains, teams, bounded contexts, software modules and deployment units (like monoliths or microservices)
- Depth of coupling between various elements of a system
- Cross-team coordination and requirements processes
- Technical Integration and manual organizational solutions
- Power dynamics between teams and their responsibilities
- Cognitive load of teams

## Inspiration for STA-Maps

STA-Maps were not invented from the ground up, instead they were heavily inspired by visualization techniques for software architectures (such as C4, Arc42 or 4+1), Context Maps from Domain Driven Design and Team Topologies.

STA-Maps don't aim to replace any of these approches. Instead they offer some more opinionated interpretations of these ideas and a connection between them towards a more holistic perspective.
